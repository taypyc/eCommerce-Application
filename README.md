# eCommerce Application

Used technologies: React , MUI component library, Redux state manager, ReactRouter router (replaced with #HashRouter in the demo, which is more friendly with GitHub Pages. Also used ReduxPersist to save data to Local Storage, ReactHookForm for the order form and AXIOS for API requests.

Implemented: the main page with product cards and filtering by category, a cart where you can place your order, a section of favorite products and a search component in the header. Such a small shop!
